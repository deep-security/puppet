# Project Retired

Recent released of Trend Micro's Deep Security provide an improved in-product experience of creating a deployment script for deploying the Deep Security Agent. With these improvements, it's trivial to deploy the agent via a simple Puppet manifest. Therefore, this project will be retired and archived.
